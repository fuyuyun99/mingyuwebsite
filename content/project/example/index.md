title: Optimal Service Rate Control Considering Patientsâ€™ Retrial
summary: We built a 2-dimensional queueing model to simulate such a circumstance, after treatment at the hospital, there is a certain probability that the patient will go back to the hospital for treatment. Under the long-run cost, we investigated how to optimally control the service rate of the hospital to minimize the overall cost.

We considered such a circumstance: patients come to the hospital for treatment with rate $\lambda$. There is only one server and first-come-first-served in the ordinary queue. This server serves at two different rates $\mu_h$ and $\mu_h$, wich can be dynamically adjusted based on the on-site situation. However, if the treatment is unsuccessful, patients have a probability of entering an orbit queue and each patient in the orbit queue will go back to the ordinary queue with rate $\lambda$ independently. 

In this model, cost happens in three places: a waiting cost $h$ for each patient in the ordinary queue, service cost rate $c_h$ or $c_l$ and a penalty cost $c_p$ for each entry into the orbit queue.
